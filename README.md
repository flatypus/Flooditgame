# Flooditgame
Made this in my first year as a second year project, but i took it too far by making a AI out of the game  <br />
The ai is really bad, with like a 70-80% win percentage, but the game is fully functioning <br />
It's object oriented and uses fltk because our teacher wanted us to use it lmao <br />
